## How to Use

The CrowdsaleLib is made up of several libraries, each catered toward a specific type of crowdsale. To create a crowdsale contract developers should decide what type of crowdsale best suits their need from the descriptions below and then dive into that directory. Every crowdsale library uses the CrowdsaleLib.sol and CrowdsaleLib.json files found here in this directory as a base contract and you should place these files in your project.

## Crowdsale Types

### Direct Crowdsale

The DirectCrowdsale is for sales that have a high supply of tokens relative to demand and do not anticipate a rush into the auction. This is the simplest of crowdsales and provides mechanisms for a basic eth-in/token-out auction.

### Even Distribution Crowdsale

The EvenDistroCrowdsale is for auctions that pre-register buyers before the sale and only allow white-listed addresses to participate. The sale owners have up to three days before the sale to register all participating addresses. Additionally, each address will have either a static purchase cap set or a dynamically generated cap based on the number of registrants and total raise cap.
